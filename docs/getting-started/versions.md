# Versions

During the development of this solution, multiple tool versions were released. It's crucial to note that previous versions are NOT compatible with the latest update. This documentation is tailored specifically for the usage of the current version.

We highly recommend migrating from older versions to the latest release, as no support is provided for any previous versions.
