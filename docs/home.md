## Introduction

For many years, I have used Laravel, and I believe it is the framework that breathes the best life into PHP. However, the creation of Helpers has not been standardized within this framework. Thus, I decided to create a standard and implement it across the various systems and companies I have worked with. Today, many colleagues have decided to support this initiative and create a package that becomes a powerful feature in Laravel.

Our solution offers a simple, efficient, and elegant way to execute your application's custom methods from any class or view, making development much easier. Enhance your Laravel project while maintaining the elegance and cleanliness of your code with this package.

We have oriented the entire use of Helpers towards classes and, most importantly, centralized the existing Laravel helpers through the categories of this package. We include native Laravel functionalities accessible through classes like `Str::` and `Arr::`. Other helpers that are not accessed via classes but as functions should continue to be used as presented in Laravel's official documentation.

It's time to standardize how we create and use helpers in our projects.
